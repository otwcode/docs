# otwcode/docs

This repo contains the front end documentation for otwarchive. It allows us more
flexibility for things like diagrams than the built-in wiki option.

For other documentation concerning the otwarchive project, such as contributing
guidelines, help setting up a development environment, and so on, please refer
